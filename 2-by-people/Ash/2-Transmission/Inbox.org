**** Ash evasive on whether Mother knows what transmission is

ash still answering questions evasively:

RIPLEY Have you tried putting the transmission through ECIU.
              
ASH (voice over) Mother hasn't identified it as yet. It's not a language.

**** Ripley's study of the transmission yields results before Ash's. Strange.
