**** Ash argues against warning Dallas - zero empathy, sound reasons

RIPLEY: Ash, tell Dallas Mother speculates that the noise is some kind of
warning.

warning can't get through

ASH: vetoes ripley going to warn dallas, because minimum takeoff crew.

ASH: What's the point. In the time it take to get there. They'll know if it's a
warning.

**** Ash completely unconcerned with Kane, only with specimen

RIPLEY What about Kane.

Ash turns back to the bunk. Studies the life support gauges. Kane continues to breathe steadily.

ASH Running a fever. And still unconscious. The machine will bring his temperature down. His vital functions are strong... who knows, he may make it.

Ash begins to seal the Alien in a large vacuum tube.

Kane is VERY contaminated, with alien mass growing in chest, and these idiots show no thought of operating, or putting into stasis.
