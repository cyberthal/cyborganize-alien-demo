*** offset

**** Ash is a little evasive on whether can land on planet

Dallas: "can we land on it?"
Ash: "the other ship did"

**** Ash furtively shuts off monitor when Ripley calls him during expedition

Ripley maybe catches ash looking suspicious

does the furtive monitor shutoff when she talks to him

she can't see what was on her screen

**** Ash still evasive about every little thing. 

Perfect for a deceiver. Never know when he's lying.
