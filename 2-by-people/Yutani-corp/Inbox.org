**** Why would Yutani Corp risk such an expensive ship?

because first contact is worth it

need something isolated, small crew, that unsuspiciously can travel deep space routes

need something they can slip a science officer on board of

and that has an advanced controlling AI - Mother
Petroleum refineries need big AI

guess they figure worst case they know where the ship's gonna be, and they can always pick it up later.

perhaps most importantly: 

If they make contact with live aliens, they don't want to give them a ship that's nimble, mobile, stealthy and military.

They want to give them a barge tug.

A refinery probably doesn't give them much they can use.
