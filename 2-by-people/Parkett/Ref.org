* Brett and Parker - true love

*** offset

**** stupid unimaginative immature dorks, with some decency beneath the prole

discontent with lower pay rank

**** brett and parker always griping and grifting

little implied sexual harassment from the idiot twins
want shares from salvage.

**** were they bought?

They couldn't play it off very well.
They're as subtle as bricks.
They got greed, sure.
Maybe bribed to do something. It's possible.
But sabotage the ship? Probably not that smart and brave...
Tough to see how they could trust each other that strongly not to snitch, either.
