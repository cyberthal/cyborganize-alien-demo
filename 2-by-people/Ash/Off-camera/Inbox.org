**** Dallas confronts Ash (finally). Ash denies all.

Ash avoidant
Dallas insistent, dominant

Dallas accuses him of wanting the alien to stay alive. Asks why. We're both working for the same company. Just clue me in.

Ash denies everything, acts offended. 

Ash enraged. Probably doesn't like having to lie.

What were his exact words? 

Maybe Ash was carefully lying: 

"I'm not sure you're getting through to me."

"The Alien is a dangerous form of life...I don't want it to stay alive any more than you do."
Maybe Ash hates all life, but is no more free than Dallas is, or considerably less so.

Anyhow, Ripley isn't privy to this conversation.

She should've been pushing much harder for Dallas to confront Ash, but instead she just fucks the alpha to console herself, and puts all her faith in him. Perhaps she's right to build up the leader. They need him, clearly.
